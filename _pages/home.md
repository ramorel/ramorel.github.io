[Me](http://ramorel.github.io/about)? I’m a doctoral candidate in the Human Development and Social Policy program at Northwestern University.

I’m currently on the job market. Here’s my [CV](http://ramorel.github.io/CV).

I study how social relationships shape the development implementation of education policy. My theoretical and methodological toolkit includes organizational sociology, social movement theory, social network analysis, and qualitative analysis. I also have a lot of training in econometrics and methods for causal inference.

I was an [IES pre-doctoral fellow](http://www.mpes.sesp.northwestern.edu/people/current-students/) from Fall 2014 to Summer 2017.

My department profile is [here](http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/profile/?p=22703&/RichardPaquin%20Morel/).

I have some code for network analysis on my [github page](http://www.github.com/ramorel).

Before beginning my doctoral studies, I was an elementary school teacher in Brooklyn, NY. I was a New York City Teaching Fellow, cohort 12, from 2006-2008. Before that, I was in a PhD program in philosophy where I studied American pragmatism (especially the work of John Dewey), phenomenology, and philosophy of language. I left with my MA to become a teacher.
