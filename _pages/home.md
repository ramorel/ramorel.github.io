[Me](http://ramorel.github.io/about)? I'm a postdoctoral research at the [Learning Research and Development Center](http://www.lrdc.pitt.edu/) at the University of Pittsburgh. I recently complete my Ph.D. in Human Development and Social Policy at Northwestern University.

Check out my [CV](https://ramorel.github.io/cv/).

I study education policy and politics. I have two related research interests:
 1. I am interested in how dominant groups maintain inequalities in access to educational opportunities and resources and the implications of this for education policy. [My dissertation studies this](https://ramorel.github.io/research/dissertation/).
 2. I also study how [power and influence in social networks shape ideas about and responses to education policies](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/0002831218788528). 
 3. My methodological toolkit includes network analysis, computational methods, and applied econometrics. I am interested in mixed-methods approaches, as well, particularly those combining qualitative analysis with computational methods.
