Hi, I'm Richard. Here's bit about me:

  1. I am a PhD candidate in Human Development and Social Policy at Northwestern University. See my profiles [here](http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/profile/?p=22703&/RichardPaquin%20Morel/) and [here](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/about/student-research/graduate-research-assistants-1718.html).  
  2. I study the relationships between social forces, particularly social movements, and education policy, and the implications for educational equity and opportunity.   
  3. I am ABD. Phew!  
  4. I'm on the job market!  
  5. Iâ€™m a big fan of R.
