Hi, I'm Richard. Here's bit about me:

  1. I finished my PhD in Human Development and Social Policy at Northwestern University in Summer 2019. See my profiles [here](http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/profile/?p=22703&/RichardPaquin%20Morel/) and [here](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/about/student-research/graduate-research-assistants-1718.html).  
  2. I study how collective action shape the development and implementation of educational policies and the consequences of that for educational equity and opportunity. I am especially interested in understanding how dominant groups, through intentional and unintentional means, maintain inequality. 
  3. I'm on the job market!  
  4. I in R and occasionally Python  
  5. I have two wonderful children, who, in the interest of privacy, shall remain unnamed.
