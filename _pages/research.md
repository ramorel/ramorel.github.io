I study how social factors within and outside of educational institutions influence the development and implementation of educational policies, with particular attention to education-related social movements. I aim to understand how such factors shape the landscape of educational opportunity in the U.S.

My dissertation analyzes the development and mobilization of a social movement that opposes the use of high-stakes standardized tests in public schools for accountability purposes.

Here's an abstract:

Standards-based accountability policies—with high-stakes standardized tests as one of its central instruments—are one of the most consequential reforms in the U.S. educational system. The recent emergence of a social movement opposing the use of standardized tests for accountability purposes. Seeking to redefine the role of testing the K-12 system, a coalition of parents and educators have organized and promoted collective action by boycotting annual accountability tests. In three studies, my dissertation explores the development and organization of a movement infrastructure, how activists use [discursive tactics to mobilize supporters](https://ramorel.github.io/files/study2_working_paper.pdf) and shape public opinions, and the role of [racial group threat](https://ramorel.github.io/files/study3_working_paper.pdf) in test boycotts.
