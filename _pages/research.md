### Research interests

Overall, I study how social factors within and outside of educational institutions influence the development and implementation of educational policies and the implications of this for access to educational resources and opportunities. This plays out in two ways in my research:

1. I am interested in how socially dominant groups _maintain_ inequalities in access to educational opportunities and resources and the implications of this for education policies that seek to expand access to underserved groups. My [dissertation](https://ramorel.github.io/research/dissertation/) explored this.

2. I am also interested in how power and influence in social networks shape ideas about and responses to education policies.

Here are some examples:

  - [_Shaping policy ideas in social networks_](https://ramorel.github.io/publication/access_activation_and_influence): How do influential people in social networks access and share information in the wake of major policy changes? 
  - [_The mobilization of educational social movements_](https://ramorel.github.io/research/dissertation/)
  - [_How do social movements shape ideas about educational policies?_](https://ramorel.github.io/research/dissertation/)
