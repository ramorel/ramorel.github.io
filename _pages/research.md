I study how social factors within and outside of educational institutions influence the development and implementation of educational policies.

  - [_Shaping policy ideas in social networks_](https://ramorel.github.io/publication/access_activation_and_influence): How do influential people in social networks access and share information in the wake of major policy changes? 
  - [_The mobilization of educational social movements_](https://ramorel.github.io/research/dissertation/)
  - [_How do social movements shape ideas about educational policies?_](https://ramorel.github.io/research/dissertation/)

My dissertation analyzes the development and mobilization on an anti-standardized testing social movement. 

Here's an abstract:

Standards-based accountability policies—with high-stakes standardized tests as one of its central instruments—are one of the most consequential reforms in the U.S. educational system. The recent emergence of anti-testing social movements among parents challenges this status quo. Seeking to redefine the role of testing the K-12 system, a coalition of parents and educators have organized and promoted collective action by boycotting annual accountability testing. In three studies, my dissertation explores the development and organization of a movement infrastructure, how activists use discursive tactics to mobilize supporters and shape public opinions, and the role of [group threat](http://ramorel.github.io/dissertation_3) in test boycotts.
