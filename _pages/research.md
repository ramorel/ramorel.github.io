1. I study how social factors within and outside of educational institutions influence the development and implementation of educational policies, in order to understand how such factors shape the landscape of educational opportunity in the U.S. I am particularly interested in how dominant groups seek to maintain inequalities--intentionally or not--through extra-institutional channels.  

2. I also study the mediation of information about educational policies through social networks, with an emphasis on extra-institutional network--meaning those that span school and district boundaries.

Here are some examples:

  - [_Shaping policy ideas in social networks_](https://ramorel.github.io/publication/access_activation_and_influence): How do influential people in social networks access and share information in the wake of major policy changes? 
  - [_The mobilization of educational social movements_](https://ramorel.github.io/research/dissertation/)
  - [_How do social movements shape ideas about educational policies?_](https://ramorel.github.io/research/dissertation/)

My dissertation analyzes the development and mobilization of a social movement that opposes the use of high-stakes standardized tests in public schools for accountability purposes.

Here's an abstract:

Standards-based accountability policies—with high-stakes standardized tests as one of its central instruments—are one of the most consequential reforms in the U.S. educational system. The recent emergence of a social movement opposing the use of standardized tests for accountability purposes. Seeking to redefine the role of testing the K-12 system, a coalition of parents and educators have organized and promoted collective action by boycotting annual accountability tests. In three studies, my dissertation explores the development and organization of a movement infrastructure, how activists use [discursive tactics to mobilize supporters](https://ramorel.github.io/files/study2_working_paper.pdf) and shape public opinions, and the role of [racial group threat](https://ramorel.github.io/files/study3_working_paper.pdf) in test boycotts.
