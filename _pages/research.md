### Research interests

Overall, I study how social factors within and outside of organizations shape how people understand and respond to policies. Most of my work looks at educational organizations, such as school or professional development providers.

Here are some examples:

  - [_Shaping policy ideas in social networks_](https://ramorel.github.io/publication/access_activation_and_influence): How do influential people in social networks access and share information in the wake of major policy changes? 
  - [_The mobilization of educational social movements_](https://ramorel.github.io/research/dissertation/)
  - [_How do social movements shape ideas about educational policies?_](https://ramorel.github.io/research/dissertation/)
