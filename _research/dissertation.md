## Test Questions: The mobilization of the anti-standardized testing movement

My dissertation consists of three studies of the "opt-out" movement--a coalition of parents and educators who oppose the use of standardized tests for "high-stakes" accountability purposes.

Study 1: How have activists used social media platforms to develop a movement infrastructure supporting collective action?

Study 2: _Strange frame fellows: The evoluation of discursive framing in the opt-out movement_ 

Standardized tests are a cornerstone of accountability policies, yet they face increasing opposition from a coalition of parents and educators, who encourage boycotts of annual tests. Activists use a variety of discursive tactics to attract people to their cause, typically relying on an underlying ideological compatibility between activists and their target audience. How do activists use discursive tactics when they seek to mobilize an ideologically diverse base? Taking the case of the opt-out movement in New York State, I analyze how activists frame issues around testing to appeal to a broad audience. Using a longitudinal text corpus consisting of posts to movement-aligned Facebook group pages, I find that activists used four prominent framing strategies: (1) using locally-oriented frames that viewed testing as harmful to children and local schools; (2) using technically-oriented frames that attacked the legitimacy of the tests; (3) using socially-oriented frames that cast the tests as a tool for undermine the public school system; and (4) particularizing and personalizing frames, making the need to act urgent. I then use hierarchical cluster analysis to document how activists emphasized the first two types frames and downplayed the more ideologically-tinged social frames. The case provides insights into how activists use framing to appeal to a potentially diverse audience and has implications for the design and implementation of accountability policies.

Study 3: _Racialized accountability threat: Demographic changes and participation in accountability test boycotts in New York_

The use of standardized testing for accountability purposes in public schools has always generated controversy. Recently, it has faced grassroots opposition from parents, who encourage the boycotting of annual accountability tests, which have grown over the past few years. The movement consists primarily of white families in non-urban areas. What factors have contributed to their participation in boycotts of tests? I propose that a process of racialized accountability threat prompted white parents to join boycotts. Racialized accountability threat occurs when schools with little previous experience with accountability pressure face an influx of Black and Latinx studentsâ€”students that white parents often construct as of lower ability and frequently subject to government regulations. Using a panel of data accountability and demographic data from New York state and a difference-in-differences framework, I present evidence that schools with an increase in the share of black and Latinx students had seven to eight percentage points more white students participating in test boycotts that schools without such an increase. This effect is concentrated in schools in affluent, non-urban areas with little previous experience with accountability sanctions and is robust to alternative specifications and placebo tests. This finding has important implications for the use of policy to address inequities in access to educational resources and opportunities.
