## Test Questions: The mobilization of the anti-standardized testing movement

My dissertation consists of three studies of the "opt-out" movement--a coalition of parents and educators who oppose the use of standardized tests for "high-stakes" accountability purposes.

I will fill these in soon :)

- Study 1: How have activists used social media to develop a movement infrastructure supporting collective action?

- Study 2: How do participants in the anti-testing movement frame the issue of standardized testing in schools?

- Study 3: What is the effect of demographic changes on participation in test boycotts?
