## Test Questions: The mobilization of the anti-standardized testing movement

My dissertation consists of three studies of the "opt-out" movement--a coalition of parents and educators who oppose the use of standardized tests for "high-stakes" accountability purposes.

I will fill these in soon :)

- Study 1: How have activists used social media to develop a movement infrastructure supporting collective action?

- Study 2: How do anti-high-stakes-testing activists frame ideas about standardized tests?

- Study 3: What is the effect of demographic changes on participation in test boycotts?
    - [Here's a short summary/overview of this study](https://ramorel.github.io/dissertation_3)
    - BEWARE: it is still a work in progress!
